Installation

Go to Raspberry Pi Configuration and turn on SSH, I2C, Serial Port, and 1-Wire

Download these files and put them in the pi’s home folder:

chirp.py - library for soil moisture sensor
windspeed.py
winddir.py
uv.py
tph.py
soiltemp.py
soilmoist.py
rainfall.py - runs nonstop by itself, records time whenever 0.2794 mm is accumulated
collectdata.sh - runs the .py files except rainfall.py every 10 mins to collect data into output files
startup.sh - runs all files accordingly on startup

In terminal in home folder, install necessary Python libraries using these commands:
sudo pip3 install bme280
sudo pip3 install RPi.bme280
sudo pip3 install w1thermsensor
sudo pip3 install smbus2
sudo pip3 install adafruit-blinka
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-veml6075
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ads1x15

In terminal in home folder, run the following commands to make the .sh files executable:
chmod +x collectdata.sh
chmod +x startup.sh

In terminal in home folder, run sudo nano .bashrc
Then, add the following command to the bottom of the file:
